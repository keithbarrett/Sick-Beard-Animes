sudo apt-get install pkg-config python2.7-dev libnspr4-dev python-setuptools gcc
(These packages are needed if not already installed)


git clone git://github.com/davisp/python-spidermonkey.git
cd python-spidermonkey
python setup.py build

If build fails because of "jsautocfg.h" file missing, copy the files "jsautocfg.h" and "jsautokw.h" to "spidermonkey/libjs/" directory from:
-"spidermonkey/Linux-i686/" for 32bits
-"spidermonkey/Linux-x86_64/" for 64 bits
(it happens on Raspberry pi because architecture is armv6l for example)

python setup.py test
(Some tests may fail, but it does not mean that python-spidermonkey will not work)

sudo python setup.py install

You are ready to use Python SpiderMonkey !

(This has been tested only on Ubuntu and RaspBMC for the moment)
